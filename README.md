## ReachOut README:

### ReachOut:

- ReachOut was build out of my frustrating with not keeping in touch with friends and family that I care about. I often found myself going weeks without speaking to them. I developed ReachOut as an automated system to remind me to keep in tough.
- After signing up users can create contacts, people they would like to keep in touch with, and set reachouts, reminders to reach out to them, on whatever schedule they would like.
- It utilizes several API's to send automated reminder texts and ideas of what to reach out about.
- This was the largest app I had built at the time and I worked on it over the course of five weeks.
- You can find it online at (LINK)

## Credits and references

1. Projects that inspired me: A terrible google calendar system I built years ago that resulted in me constantly putting off calendar reminders.
2. I started this project while I was at Actualize Coding Bootcamp. That experience was very helpful when I was getting the architecture of the project set up.
